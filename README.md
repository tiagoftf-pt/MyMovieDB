ðŸš€ Introducing My New React WebApp, <b>MyMovieDB</b>! ðŸš€

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project: a webapp developed entirely in React! ðŸŽ‰

This project is part of a series of key projects that I am developing as part of a REACT learning course.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

<p>React: For a dynamic and responsive user interface.</p>
<p>React Router: For handling routing.</p>
<p>Tailwind CSS: For a modern and stylish design.</p>
<p>Integrating with external APIs for dynamic data.</p>

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

<p>Integrating with external APIs for dynamic data.</p>
<p>Custom hooks.</p>
<p>Dark Mode integration.</p>
<p>Responsive Design: Accessible on any device, whether desktop or mobile.</p>
<p>Deploy your projects on Netlify using Git & Github.</p>

ðŸ”¹ Next Steps:

<p>Adding new features based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Continuing to optimize performance and security.</p>

Iâ€™m very proud of what has been achieved so far and excited to keep improving this webapp.
